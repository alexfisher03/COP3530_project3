# Project Title: Craigslist CarCache
## COP3530 Project 3
---
## Problem Statement:
- `Due to the volatility of the used car market, it is difficult to determine a fair value for a used vehicle. In recent years, the Kelley Blue Book, which used to be the gold standard for used car values, has become obsolete and completely unreliable. This means there must be an updated, accurate way to see what cars should be listed for and purchased for in todayâ€™s climate. A visualization and easy way to compare vehicle values will allow car buyers and sellers to appropriately price and purchase vehicles in a scalable way`
